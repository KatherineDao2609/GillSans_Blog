     <strong>Arthur Eric Rowton Gill (1882 – 1940)</strong> As known as Eric Gill, was a reputable British sculptor, letter cutter, typeface designer, and printmaker. He has created a variety of well-known artworks in multiple fields of art, including type design. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography has praised Gill as "the greatest artist-craftsman of the twentieth century: a letter-cutter and type designer of genius", showing that Gill was a highly influential typeface designer.

     <strong>Originally,</strong> Gill was trained as a sculptor, he later applied exceptional sculpting skills to the creation of typefaces. With a strong sense in permanence and solidity was delivered to his typography artworks, Gill started carving typefaces on enduring quality material, such as stones and metal surfaces, including the lettering for the London Underground, which is still in use today. He believed that typefaces should be created by carving them in stone, rather than by drawing them on paper. This ideology allowed him to create typefaces that were more tactile and organic than those created through purely digital means.<br><br>

It is noteworthy that he was the designer of two iconic Gill Sans and Perpetua typefaces, which have been used for many decades since their creation in the 1920s. Gill Sans is a humanist sans-serif typeface, not only popular for its clean, modernist look, but also significantly legible at small sizes. Therefore, Gill Sans is widely used today in a range of applications, from print, signage design to branding. BBC, Calvin Klein, London Underground advertising and Penguin Books are notable brands that have been using Gill Sans for either logo, book covers, advertising publications, etc. In comparison with Gill Sans, Perpetua is inspired by Roman classical lettering; it is a serif font that has a distinctive, elegant and sophisticated appearance. This font is often used in applications when a traditional and formal look is desired. For example, Penguin Books has been using Perpetua in classical literature or poem books, Burberry also has Perpetua typeface in its branding and marketing campaigns to match the high-end, elegant, refined image of the brand, this typeface is frequently selected for wine labels and fashion magazines.
