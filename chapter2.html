     <strong>Gill’s perspective</strong> is devoted to humanist typography, which has had a lasting impact on the field of typography. Particularly, Gill believed that typography should be humanist, meaning that it should reflect the natural shapes and forms of the human body. He also rejected the purely geometric forms of some modernist typefaces and instead sought to create typefaces that were more organic and fluid. This approach was a significant departure from the prevailing trends in typography at the time, and it helped to influence the development of typeface art in the 20th century.<br><br>

He believed that typography is not only an art form, but also a path of communication. Gill was interested in the relationship between typography and language, that typography should contain layers of messages and be used in a way that enhances the meaning of the text, instead of purely focusing on visual appeals. His work helped to elevate typography from a purely functional art form to a form of artistic expression. This ideology has influenced deeply to other typographers and designers of his time and beyond, including Edward Johnston, Eric Gill’s  mentor and fellow typeface designer. <br><br><br>

     In addition to the creation of typefaces, his contributions to the letter carving and traditional craftsmanship has tremendously impacted contemporary designers and typographers to prioritize quality and craftsmanship in their work. This “direct carving” technique has helped to shape the individual workshop movement in Britain, particularly in the early 1970s, and established a new appreciation for the value of hand-crafted design work.<br><br>
     Eric Gill also has profoundly influential impacts on typography education and the establishment of typography as an academic discipline. From his letter-carving artworks and the embracement of traditional craftsmanship, Gill has established new standards for typography education. During his time working as an typography and lettering instructor at various institutions, including the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London, his teaching methods and philosophy have influenced many contemporary typography educators, and his legacy can be seen in the numerous typography programs and courses offered by universities and design schools around the world.<br><br>
     Eric Gill’s work in typography is widely recognized as groundbreaking and influential, and he is considered to be one of the most important figures in the history of typography. However, his legacy has been marred by controversy, particularly with regards to his personal life and his views on sexuality, which have been criticized as being inappropriate and even abusive. Despite these criticisms, Gill’s contributions to typography and design continue to be studied and celebrated by designers and typographers around the world, and his influence can be seen in countless examples of typography and design work today.
